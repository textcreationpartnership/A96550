            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>THe State of Our Affairs Abroad, requiring Our going beyond Seas, was the Cauſe of Our Adjourning your Meeting till this time; When we ordered the laſt Adjournment by Our Letter then pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, We fully expreſt Our good Intentions towards that Our Ancient Kingdom, which We are now ready to make good in this Seſſion of Parliament.</p>
            <p>We have conſidered the Addreſs you made to Us in the Seſſion of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment 1698, in behalf of the <hi>African Company,</hi> repreſenting the ſame as a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Concern, and do aſſure you, that We are very willing to aſſent to what ſhall be reaſonably propoſed for repairing the Loſſes, and Supporting and Promoting the Intereſt of that COMPANY: And having ever recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Eaſe and Proſperity of Our good Subjects Our greateſt Honour and Happineſs; We are likewiſe moſt willing to agree to all that can be deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, for maintaining and advancing the Peace and Welfare of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>And that you and all Our good Subjects may have full and ſatisfying Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of this Our good Mind; We again Declare, That We are reſolved to give Our Royal Aſſent to all Acts that ſhall be offered for the better eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing the true Proteſtant Religion, and the Presbyterian Government of the Church, which you enjoy, for the more effectual preventing the grouth of Popery, for the repreſſing of Vice and Immorality, and the Incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Piety and Vertue, for the preſerving and ſecuring of perſonal Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for the regulating and advanceing of Trade; And more eſpecially for making up the Loſſes, and promoting the Concerns of the <hi>African</hi> and <hi>Indian</hi> COMPANY, for the ſetting forward and improving Manufactories, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, We are ready to give Our Aſſent to all other Laws that ſhall be brought in for the farder clearing and ſecuring Property and Civil Rights, ſtrengthning and facilitating the Adminiſtration of Juſtice, reſtraining and puniſhing of Crimes, and the preſerving the Peace and Quiet of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ſo that nothing ſhall be wanting on Our part to make Our People both Happy and Contented.</p>
            <p>It is truly Our Regrate, that We could not agree to the Aſſerting of the Right of the COMPANIES Collony in <hi>Darien,</hi> and you may be very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, if it had not been for invincible Reaſons, the preſſing Deſires of all Our Miniſters, with the Inclination of Our good Subjects therein concerned, had undoubtedly prevailed, but ſince We were, and are fully ſatisfied, that Our yeilding in that Matter, had infallibly diſturbed the general Peace of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome,</hi> and brought inevitably upon that Our Ancient Kingdom a heavy Warr, wherein We could expect no Aſſiſtance; And that now the ſtate of that Affair is quite altered, We doubt not but you will reſt ſatisfied with theſe plain Reaſons.</p>

            <!-- PDF PAGE 84 -->
            <p>We are heartily ſorry for the COMPANIES Loſs in what hath happned, but We being moſt willing that the COMPANIES Loſſes be repaired, and ready to concur in any new Projects or Deſign that ſhall be reaſonably propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for the Good and Advantage of the Kingdom, We are moſt confident, the Wiſdom of the Parliament will no longer Stop upon this Obſtruction, Having then this happy Opportunity for the promoving of the Good and Welfare of the Kingdom, you will certainly lay hold upon it; And ſeing you cannot but notice the Deſigns and Practices of Perſons diſaffected both to Our Government and your Peace, and how Watchful and Ready Our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies are, alſe well at Home as Abroad, and deſireous of nothing more as that Differences may fall in amongſt Us; We are perſwaded you will be no leſs carefull to avoid them. All that We demand is, that you would provide proper and competent Supplies for ſuch Forces as ſhall be neceſſary for the Kingdoms Security, and to maintain it in it's preſent happy Settlement.</p>
            <p>We have continued the Duke of <hi>Queensberry</hi> to be Our Commiſſioner for repreſenting Us in this Seſſion of Parliament, as a Perſon of whoſe Ability and Fidelity We have made full Proof, and are aſſured will be to you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable; And therefore you are to give him full Credit: And We expect that in all things you will proceed with that Wiſdom, Calmneſs and Unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, as that this Seſſion may be concluded to Our mutual Satisfaction, and to the Joy of all Our good Subjects: And ſo We bid you heartily Farewel.</p>

On <date>

               <salute>MY LORDS AND GENTLEMEN,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AT our laſt Meeting, I told you that I was inſtructed by His Majeſty in every thing that could appear neceſſary or convenient for the intereſt of this Kingdom, and of ſolid uſe to the <hi>Indian</hi> and <hi>African</hi> Company.</p>
            <p>You have ample aſſurances renewed to you ſince that time, that His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty retracts nothing that was then deſigned for the welfare and ſatisfaction of His People, as He has plainly expreſt, in a Letter to His Privy Council, publiſhed by His ſpecial Order, that all His Majeſties good Subjects might have the advantage to underſtand, and leaſure to reflect and conſider on the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate of Affairs, and that you might come together with a cheerful diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, to give His Majeſty juſt and full Concurrance in what is laid before you.</p>
            <p>I wiſh the Kingdom had ſooner received the benefite of His Majeſties good intentions, but you have it now in your power to repair that loſs.</p>
            <p>His Majeſties moſt gracious Letter which you have heard read, does clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confirm all that was formerly offered, or can be reaſonably propoſed to make you happy</p>
            <p>It is with regrate the King tells you that He cannot agree to aſſert the Right of the <hi>Indian</hi> and <hi>African</hi> Company's Collony in <hi>Darien,</hi> He perfectly knows the earneſt deſire of theſe concerned in it, and of many others of His good Subjects, and does His Servants Juſtice in that matter.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty would certainly have granted what was ſo preſſingly deſired, had he not known that his yielding that point muſt have diſturbed the peace of <hi>Europe,</hi> and ingaged us is a War, in which he could expect no ſupport.</p>
            <p>The circumſtances of that Affair are ſo much altered, that you cannot but be convinced it is unneceſſary at preſent to aſſert that Right; and the inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon it may obſtruct things of more value, both to the Nation, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:137420:4"/>
            <!-- PDF PAGE 85 -->
            <p>It may be the endeavour of ſome in the Nation, who are diſaffected to the Government of the Church and State, to influence you to preſs the aſſerting the Right of the Collony; and the more they ſee His Majeſty ſtraitned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt his inclinations to ſatisfie the Company, and His care to preſerve the Peace of Chriſtendome, the more they will urge you to it.</p>
            <p>It muſt therefore be highly ſuitable to the Wiſdom of this Parliament, to be a warr of ſuch Artifices, and to apply themſelves to diſappoint any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage our Enemies at home or abroad may make of the leaſt appearance of difference amongſt us.</p>
            <p>For this reaſon I cannot doubt but you will unanimouſly proceed to theſe things that are more valuable, and intirely in your power.</p>
            <p>For His Majeſty is willing to concurr with you in maintaining and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Proteſtant Religion, and Presbyterian Government of the Church; in putting a ſtop to the grouth of Popery, repreſſing Vice and Immorality, in providing for the liberty of your Perſons by a clear and perpetual Law.</p>
            <p>And His Majeſty is alſo willing that you proceed to ſuch Laws as may advance the Trade &amp; welfare of the Kingdom particularly the true intereſt of the <hi>Indian</hi> and <hi>African</hi> Company, and Erect and Improve Manufactories, imploy and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the Poor, and clear and ſecure private Rights and Property, ſtrengthen and facilitat the Adminiſtration of Juſtice, reſtrain and puniſh Crimes, and generally to do all that may ſecure the Peace, and promote the Welfare of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>My inſtructions are full in relation to theſe matters; So His Majeſty has done every thing that can be deſired on His part.</p>
            <p>The King on the other hand demands nothing of you, but competent Supplies for maintaining ſuch Forces as are neceſſary for the Security of the Nation, in which I aſſure my ſelf of your ready complyance.</p>
            <p>I know &amp; do heartily regrate that the Nation is brought low by the Scarcity which has continued for ſeveral years, &amp; by other misfortunes. And I ſhould be as tender as any Man to have heavy Burdens laid upon it: But I think no good Subject will grudge to contribute what is neceſſary to ſupport the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſecure our ſelves from the Inſults and Rapine of ill Men, which cannot be done without new Supplies.</p>

            <p>His Majeſtie in his Letter to you when you laſt met, told you of His firm Reſolution to make it the chief deſign of His Reign to do every thing that may tend to the Advantage and Good of His Subjects, and the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners Grace acquainted you in that Meeting that he had full power and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions for every thing that appeared neceſſary or convenient for the Good and Advantage of the Nation, as to Religion, Property, Liberty, Trade, and particularly what could be of moſt ſolid uſe to the <hi>African</hi> and <hi>Indian</hi> Company.</p>
            <p>Since that time, His Majeſty by a Letter to His Privy Council, publiſhed by his Order, for the Satisfaction of His Good Subjects, has repeated the ſame Aſſurances which were formerly given you, and has expreſſed his good In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions towards this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Now again His Majeſty by His moſt Gracious Letter Read in your Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, is pleaſed fully and kindly to certifie you, that he continues firm in the ſame good Intentions, ſtill reckoning the Eaſe and Proſperity of His good Subjects to be His greateſt Honor and Happineſs.</p>
            <p>Theſe ample and full Aſſurances which His Majeſty has in His Letter given you, are ſo diſtinctly expreſſed in it, and in the Diſcourſe the Commiſſioners Grace has had to you, that it were ſuperfluous to me to add much to what you have heard. Only I muſt much take notice, and <hi>I</hi> wiſh that you may do ſo too, of the large extent of His Majeſties good Intentions towards his Subjects of this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>His Majeſtie is reſolved to give the Royal Aſſent to all Acts for the better eſtabliſhing the true Proteſtant Religion and the Presbyterian Government of the Church which we Enjoy. For the more effectual preventing the grouth of Popery, for the repreſſing of Vice and Immorali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Encouragement of Piety and Virtue, for the preſerving and ſecuring of perſonal Liberty, for the Regulating and Advancing of Trade, for making up the Loſſes, &amp; promoting the Concerns of the <hi>African</hi> and <hi>Indian</hi> Company, and for the ſetting forward and Improving of Manufactories.</p>
            <p>By theſe ſeven Channels, His Majeſty is diſpoſed and ready to let out unto this Nation a Stream of moſt valuable Advantages, which cannot miſs (by the Bleſſing of GOD) to make it happy.</p>
            <p>Yet leaſt theſe Heads might come ſhort of importing the extent of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties good meaning, He is pleaſed to add, that generally he is readie to give
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:137420:5"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 86 -->the Royal Aſſent to all other Laws for the further clearing and ſecuring Property and Civil Rights, for ſtrengthning and facilitating the Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Juſtice, for reſtraining and puniſhing Crimes, and for ſetling the Peace and Quiet of the Kingdom, ſo that nothing ſhall be wanting upon His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties part to make his people both Happy and Contented; What more can we reaſonably Hope, what more can we reaſonably Wiſh.</p>
            <p>Upon the other hand, all that His Majeſty demands of us, is, that we will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide proper &amp; competent Supplies for ſuch Forces as ſhal be neceſſary for the Kingdoms Security, and to maintain it in its preſent happy Settlement.</p>
            <p>And here I muſt ſay, what leſs can reaſonably be demanded, what leſs can reaſonably be expected.</p>
            <p>The many croſs Providences which the <hi>African</hi> and <hi>Indian</hi> Company has met with in the proſecution of its Deſigns, with the great Loſs both of Men and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, which has been the event of the Companies attempt, for ſettling a Colony in the Province of <hi>Darien,</hi> have much diſturbed and perplexed the minds of many, and it is too evident, that there are not wanting ſome who would raiſe and foment Jealouſies in well-meaning People of Our Soveraign the King, as if he were not enough concerned to protect and aſſiſt this Nation in what relates to its Trade.</p>
            <p>I would intreat you to take heed how you harbour ſo bad a gueſt as Jealouſie is, it is apt to darken the Underſtanding, and to diſturb the motion of the Mind, it will create Fear where no Fear is, and no ground for it, I pray you beware of it.</p>
            <p>This is undenyable, that the <hi>Scots</hi> Nation never had a King, whom it had better reaſon to truſt &amp; confide in, never had a Parliament which it had better reaſon to truſt and confide in; Seing it is ſo, we have all the reaſon in the World to do what is poſſible to us for maintaining a good Underſtanding betwixt this King and this Parliament, even as we wiſh the Proſperity and Peace of this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>There is one thing which has made a difference of Opinion amongſt us, ſome would have an Act aſſerting the Right of the Company to the Colony, which it planted upon <hi>Darien.</hi> In this matter the King has been much ſtraitned, and has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to you with regrate, that he cannot agree to the aſſerting a Right to that Colony, and that for invincible reaſons, which His Majeſty is pleaſed to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate to you.</p>
            <p>That it would infallibly diſturb the general Peace of <hi>Chriſtendome,</hi> and bring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably upon this Kingdom a heavy War, wherein we could expect no aſſiſtance. This is very evident, for the power of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy, and of thoſe concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Support of it, would be united againſt us, and we in all appearance left to our own ſtrength, without expectation of any Aſſiſtants.</p>
            <p>Beſides we are to conſider, that the Company has not now the Colony in Poſſeſſion to ſupport and maintain, but to recover by force of Arms, and we have good Reaſon, this Kingdom having ſo lately come off from a great and long War, to take notice in what Condition and Preparation the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to engage in a new one, and what Aſſiſtance we may expect.</p>
            <p>Theſe plain Reaſons, I do not doubt, will ſatisfie all theſe who are ſatisfiable, &amp; not too indifferent of keeping up a mutual Truſt and Confidence betwixt His Majeſtie and his People and Parliament.</p>

               <p>As you have great Aſſurances and Kind offers from your Soveraign at this time, whereby this Nation may be made very happy, its moſt important In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts furder ſecured, its Peace preſerved, and its Trade advanced. Let not the humor or jealouſie of any who have acceſs to the doing Buſineſs in this Juncture, hinder or obſtruct ſo great a Bleſſing as we have in proſpect.</p>
               <p>But ſeing our King is ſo ready to concur with us, let us not be backward or ſlow to concur with Him for the good of our Nation, that the people now living, and the poſterity which ſhal come after us, may have this Seſſion of Parliament in Veneration, and for a Pattern worthy to be regarded, and fit to be imitated.</p>
